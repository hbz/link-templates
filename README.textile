Templates for linking into catalogues of hbz union members and more.

h2. How to Use the Templates

The templates adhere to "RFC6570":http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570 and map an ISIL to the URI template. These can be
processed in most modern "programming languages":https://code.google.com/p/uri-templates/wiki/Implementations.
